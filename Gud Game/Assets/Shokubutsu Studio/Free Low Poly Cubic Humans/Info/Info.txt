Thank you VERY much for Purchasing The CLP Human Pack and I Hope it will serve all Your purposes in Your Projects.


A few Things to Note :


For Clarification, Each weapon Type should be Parented to the dedicated Bone and Since The 2 Handed Weapons are in contact with Both hands, This serve to clarify Which Bone has the Full control 

- Great Swords : Weapon Parented to the Right Arm
- Spears and Halberds : Weapon Parented to The right Arm
- Bows : Weapon Parented to The Left arm 


All the Other weapons should be Pretty Straight forward and The Preview Pictures AND video should give you an Idea on how they work. 


Again, Thank you Very much for your download, It would really be Nice to Leave a rating and review as it helps out a lot, And ANY suggestions You might have for my future Packs In this Art style if that's something you Fancy, well you do since you Purchased it to begin with, hahah. 

Make Indie Games Great again
Happy Game making
